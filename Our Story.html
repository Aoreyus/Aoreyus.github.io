		<div id="div">
		<p id="desc">In 2078 Aoreyus Coperation has sucessfully launched the trillion dollar space hotel. This hotel includes an artifical gravational pull generator that ensures you can experience Earth-like gravity. The engery on this hotel is generated using a combined method of solor and nuclear power. 
			We also used the recently discovered quantum magnetic techonology to build a magnetic force field that protects the hotel agansit harmful radiation. The hotel also features oxygen generatoring cells(OGC) that like the plants on Earth, converts the Carbon Dioxide into Oxgyen.However our most impressive techonology on the hotel is the abilty to generate food out of thin air! Our scientist invented carbonhydrate vending machines that produced bread on Earth by using just air and water a decade ago, now the same tenchonolgy is used in our cafeteria to produce the Aoreyus Space bread. Our research team perfected the stem cell techonology that allows us to grow thousands of steaks from just the stem cell of a cow.The technology listed above makes the Aoreyus Space Hotel the most self-sustainable hotel in the solor system, so leave all your worries behind and join us on this incredibale new age</p>
		<p id="desc">Our hotel have two teloscopes that are 10 times more powerful than the Hubble Space Teloscope. The images taken by these teloscopes are projected in our observatory. You can see galaxy in and outside of the Milky Way in HD. You also get to see Earth spinning before your own eys, watch the moon rotate around Earth all in real time! Further more apply now and we will pick 15 lucky guests to tour around the first colony of Mars fore FREE!.</p>
